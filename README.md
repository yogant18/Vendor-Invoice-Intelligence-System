<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-overview"></a>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** designed to support finance teams by:

1. **Predicting expected freight cost** for vendor invoices.
2. **Flagging high-risk invoices** that require manual review due to abnormal cost, freight, or operational patterns.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-objectives"></a>🎯 Business Objectives</h2>

### 1. Freight Cost Prediction (Regression)

**Objective:**  
Predict the expected freight cost for a vendor invoice using quantity, invoice value, and historical behavior.

**Why it matters:**
- Freight is a non-trivial component of landed cost.
- Poor freight estimation impacts margin analysis and budgeting.
- Early prediction improves procurement planning and vendor negotiation.

### 2. Invoice Risk Flagging (Classification)

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a vendor invoice should be flagged for manual approval due to abnormal cost, freight, or delivery patterns.

**Why it matters:**
- Manual invoice review does not scale.
- Financial leakage often occurs in large or complex invoices.
- Early risk detection improves audit efficiency and operational control.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-sources"></a>📂 Data Sources</h2>

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset (`inventory.db`) is too large to host on GitHub. You can download it from Google Drive:

> 📁 **[Download Dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w4Ed0bZP2zINcr58iv_MnEI6yOLulcTs?usp=sharing)**
>
> After downloading, place the file at `data/inventory.db` before running the project.

Data is stored in a relational SQLite database (`inventory.db`) with the following tables:

- `vendor_invoice` – Invoice-level financial and timing data  
- `purchases` – Item-level purchase details  
- `purchase_prices` – Reference purchase prices  
- `begin_inventory`, `end_inventory` – Inventory snapshots  

SQL aggregation is used to generate **invoice-level features**.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="eda"></a>📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

EDA focuses on **business-driven questions**, such as:

- Do flagged invoices have higher financial exposure?
- Does freight scale linearly with quantity?
- Does freight cost depend on quantity?

Statistical tests (t-tests) are used to confirm that flagged invoices differ meaningfully from normal invoices.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="models-used"></a>🤖 Models Used</h2>

### Regression (Freight Prediction)
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor (final model)

### Classification (Invoice Flagging)
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier (final model with GridSearchCV)

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **GridSearchCV** with F1-score to handle class imbalance.
